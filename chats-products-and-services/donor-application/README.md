2. Secure Payment Processing: The application ensures secure payment processing to protect donors' financial information. It integrates with trusted payment gateways to facilitate seamless and safe transactions, allowing donors to contribute with confidence.
3. Donation Tracking: Donors can easily track their donations within the application. They can view their donation history, including dates, amounts, and purposes of donations. This transparency provides donors with a clear record of their contributions.
4. Fundraising Campaigns: The application showcases ongoing fundraising campaigns initiated by the CHATS NGO. Donors can explore these campaigns, learn about their objectives, and make donations directly towards specific causes that resonate with them.

6. Donor Profiles and Preferences: The application allows donors to create profiles and customize their preferences. Donors can manage their contact information, communication preferences, and donation settings, ensuring a personalized and tailored experience.
7. Communication and Updates: The application enables effective communication between the CHATS NGO and donors.
