# ðŸ“– Overview

## How it Works

### 1. Quick Registration:

Everything begins with enrollment-this is why we have developed a **quick, open-source** and powerful system. We connect directly to CHATS Toolbox, support manual upload of data, excel imports and have a powerful API to make it simple and quick to register a recipient and vendor. **Reduced aid delivery time by 96%.**

### 2. Safe cash disbursement

We have built an open-source program that allows you to distribute relief funds in **minutes,** rather than days or weeks **transparently** to beneficiaries.

Every situation is special, so we endorse transfers of offline SMS, Android App and Tap to Pay Cards. **100% personalized** for your brand.

### 3. Monitoring in Real-time

In order to monitor operations at all times, we provide a dashboard for **real time analytics.** We have personalized filters, searches, a personalize map and other useful tools to help you gain **insight** into every program that you run.

This provides an **immutable and auditable** third parties record for donors. All transactions are logged on the Ethereum Blockchain.
