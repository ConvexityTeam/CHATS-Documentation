### Requirement gathering and analysis

To kick things off, the first step is to gather and analyse the requirements, this may involve understanding the functional and non-functional requirements as well as the business goals, user needs, e.t.c. The team would collaborate with stakeholders to define the scope of the project and create a clear roadmap with timelines (deliverables) for the project.
