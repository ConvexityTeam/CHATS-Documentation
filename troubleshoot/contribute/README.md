## Test Your Changes:

Before submitting your contribution, make sure to test your changes thoroughly. Use test frameworks (**Mocha or QUnit)** to automate the process. Once you have run the tests, you have to analyse the results. This will help you to identify any bugs or problems. If there are bugs, fix them before proceeding to commit your changes.
