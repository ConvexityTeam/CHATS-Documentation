# ðŸ“• CHATS Code of conduct

The CHATS team and community are made up of a mixture of professionals from all over the world, working on every product. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to developers and users.

As contributors and maintainers of CHATS, we are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of background or identity. This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the CHATS community.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing.

* Be respectful: Treat all participants with respect and kindness, regardless of their personal attributes or opinions. Disagreements and debates should be conducted in a civil manner.
* Inclusive language: Use inclusive language and avoid any form of discriminatory, offensive, or derogatory remarks or jokes. Be mindful of your words' impact on others.
* Open-mindedness: Embrace diversity and be open to different ideas, perspectives, and experiences. Foster an environment that encourages collaboration, creativity, and learning from one another.
* Be constructive: Provide constructive feedback and engage in discussions that aim to improve the CHATS. Critique ideas, not individuals, and always assume good intentions from others.
* Respect privacy and boundaries: Obtain consent before sharing personal information about others. Respect the privacy and boundaries of fellow contributors and users.
* Report and address issues: If you witness or experience any behavior that violates this code of conduct, promptly report it to the project maintainers. They are committed to maintaining a safe and inclusive community and will take appropriate action to address the issue.
* No harassment or discrimination: Harassment, discrimination, or any form of unwelcome behavior based on factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or any other protected characteristic will not be tolerated.
* Comply with applicable laws: Ensure that your actions and contributions comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
